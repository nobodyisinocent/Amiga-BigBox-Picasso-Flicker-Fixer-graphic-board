# Amiga BigBox Picasso Flicker Fixed graphic board
Here is a Picasso 4MB Flicker Fixed for Amiga 2000, 3000 &amp; 4000

This board is designed from the two following projects:
  - The 4MB Picasso Board V3.3 from Georg Braun (No official Website anymore),
  - The MultiFix AGA from Matthias Heinrichs aka Matze on A1k.org. The link of his project is available here:
  https://gitlab.com/MHeinrichs/multifix-aga
  
No files available actually here.
The Kicad project is finalized. If I launch a production for some PCB and I assemble one for tests, I put here the gerber files.
Please remember that it's a personnal projet.
